# Rock-Paper-Scissor Game

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Python. The player (Player 1) selects an option from "rock," "paper," or "scissor," while the computer (Player 2) makes a random choice. The game then compares the choices and determines the winner based on standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:

Rock (ðŸª¨) beats Scissors (âœ‚)
Scissors (âœ‚) beats Paper (ðŸ“„)
Paper (ðŸ“„) beats Rock (ðŸª¨)
If both the player and the computer choose the same option, the game results in a tie. The outcome is displayed with corresponding emojis for better visualization.
